## Hi Researcher! ðŸ‘‹ 
<p align="justify">
I am a Mentor at deeplearning.ai, guiding AI learners at Coursera to navigate difficulties in their learning specialization. As a developing Researcher in Deep Learning, with interest in Convolutional Neural Network, and Natural Language Processing, I want to see more of its implementation in Medicine and Healthcares, evolutionary the world, improve lifestyes and standard of living. I have worked on medical image classifications, medical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. I write blogs to guide, enlighten and educate new babies, intermediate and even advance learners to break into AI, understand some new concepts and deep learning intuition. I was privilege to serve as a Mentor at Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL2020 Conference. As a member of AI Saturdays, Data Science Nigeria, Artificial Intelligence Communities, and Team Lead of Pie and AI Community in my home country, I have continue to volunteer in community development service to bridge the AI gap on Data Literacy, Policy and Healthcare. I'm Open to AI research and opportunities!
